In this space I have the intention to store my notes related to my coding journey. The challenge of implementing Python into my scientific career comes after getting my Ph.D. degree. At that moment, I saw that all the data I had generated related to materials characterization (thin-films) were buried in my hard drive. Therefore, to overcome the lost of data I have to learn new skills for data management.
:
While I was looking for alternatives. I found that having a coding culture will be a solution because in this XXI century, DATA is the most valuable resource I will have. With this hyphothesis in my mind, I decide to challentge myself by learning Python and Git as the initial point of my joruney.

Why do you decide to learn Python?
